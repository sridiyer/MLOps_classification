# MLOps_classification

This project trained a NLP model for detecting (positive or negative) sentiments expressed in sentences.
The main components of the projects are:

<ul>
  <li>Pre-trained Transformer model finetuned for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. </li>
  <li>FastAPI based access to the model for real-time inference. </li>
  <li>Dockerized deployment - public access to docker image via AWS Container Registery</li>
  <li>Delpyment via Cloud Service (update </li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 1. Finetuning pre-trained Transformer Model</h5>
  
  
<h5>Step 2. Fast API based Real-time Inference </h5>


<h5>Step 3. Containarized Deployment </h5>
  
  
<h5>Step 4. Cloud Service </h5>
